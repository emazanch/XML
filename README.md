# XML
Modeling of the XML database of a health insurance company:
- Write an XML Schema that represents your modeling.
- Write a valid XML document against this model, containing a representative extract of the data of the health insurance company.
- Imagine (t least) 3 different scenarios requiring the visualization of some of this data and write 3 XSL stylesheets to answer them.
- Imagine (at least) a 4th scenario requiring the exploitation of part of this data in a new structure and write a stylesheet for this.
